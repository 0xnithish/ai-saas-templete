# Change: Update Homepage Content for AI SaaS Template

## Why
The current homepage contains generic business/SaaS content unrelated to AI capabilities, making it unsuitable for developers seeking an AI SaaS template. The content focuses on system monitoring rather than AI-specific features like model training, data processing, and machine learning capabilities.

## What Changes
- Replace Hero section content from monitoring focus to AI capabilities (model training, predictions, data processing)
- Update Features section to showcase AI-specific features (real-time predictions, automated data processing, custom model training)
- Change HowItWorks section from development setup to AI workflow (data upload → model training → deployment)
- Update Pricing section to reflect AI SaaS pricing tiers (model generations, API calls, training hours)
- Replace Testimonials with AI-specific use cases and results
- Update FAQ section with AI-related questions (model accuracy, data privacy, training requirements)
- Replace generic logos with AI/tech company logos
- Update all content language from generic business to AI/ML terminology

## Impact
- **Affected specs**: landing-page (new capability)
- **Affected code**: All components in `components/landing/` directory
- **User Impact**: Developers will see relevant AI SaaS content that matches their use case
- **Business Impact**: Better alignment with target audience (AI SaaS developers)
